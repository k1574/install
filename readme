# Guide

Most of k1574's programs are written in C or Golang.
For C programs as the building system is used
Plan9 program mk, which is simplified version
of make. Even so It works just fine to do it's work.
To build any of these programs you obviously need this.
To build itself is used the make program, which is
installed mostly on every Linux or BSD distributions.


## mk

	git clone https://github.com/k1574/mk
	cd mk
	# vi mkconfig
	make install

By the standard behaviour all the programs, including mk
are installed in $HOME/local/bin directory that is
supposed to replace the standard root directory and
prevent using sudo command which is pretty dangerous
and doesn't make sense since every user on your
machine can want to use his own versions of these
programs. The behaviour can be changed by editing
the mkconfig file.


## C

When you have mk you can install anything you want by this command:

	mk install

Also every application has it's own mkconfig file that can be edited.

### Variables

Some standard variables description:

 * NAME - application name.
 * VERSION - should I explain it?
 * CC - C compiler. (cc)
 * LD - object files linker. ($CC)
 * STRIP - program to remove inessential information from execs and object files. (strip)
 * LOCAL - root directory where everything is gonna be installed. ($HOME/local)
 * BIN - directory for binary files. ($LOCAL/bin)
 * SHR - consider it as alias for "share". ($LOCAL/shr)
 * MAN - directory for man pages. The structure is taken from Plan9. ($SHR/man)

### Dependencies

In general because of my laziness I just put list of packages in file
with name of the distribution I use. For example look how Voidlinux packages
can be installed after you entering the git of choosen app: (bash, dash, sh etc)
	
	sudo xbps-install -S $(cat voidlinux)	

Also: if you don't want to use sudo command then checkout

## Go 

Golang has it's own way to install stuff:

	go get -u https://github.com/k1574/<prog>	
	go install https://github.com/k1574/<prog>

### Dependencies

Golang installs everything you need by itself.
